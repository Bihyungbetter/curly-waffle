## Design Choices

- **Color Scheme**: The primary color palette uses green tones (#2c5e43) that evoke freshness and sustainability, complemented by warm accent colors (#fbba72, #f47d4f) that represent Asian cuisine's vibrancy.

- **Typography**: The site uses a combination of Playfair Display for headings (elegant, sophisticated) and Poppins for body text (clean, modern, highly readable).

- **Layout**: The layout utilizes modern design patterns with ample white space, clear visual hierarchy, and organized content sections that guide users through the site.

- **Animations**: Subtle animations enhance user experience without being distracting. They include fade effects when scrolling, hover transitions, and smooth page navigation.
